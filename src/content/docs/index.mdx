# Mission: 
### To enable effective climate action through open collaboration and transparent progress monitoring.


# Vision: 
### A world where the open-source and peer-reviewed climate solutions are shared, and reference implementations for sectors can be openly discussed without any concerns of corporate privacy being violated. We believe sharing reference decarbonization/abatement plans and strategies will enable rapid progress towards net-zero emissions across all sectors of the economy.


## Our General Princples
1. **Open collaboration and open-source approaches** over closed innovation, to harness collective intelligence and encourage diverse contributions.
2. **Dynamic responsiveness and continuous improvement** over rigid planning, to adapt strategies based on the latest findings and technologies.
3. **Modular, scalable, and interoperable solutions** over standalone projects, to enable efficient responses to climate change and seamless integration with existing systems.
4. **Small, integrative components and cost-effectiveness** over large, monolithic initiatives and hidden costs, to make climate solutions more manageable and appealing for corporations while prioritizing high-impact solutions.
5. **Transparency, trust, and vendor neutrality** over secrecy and favoritism, to foster openness, mutual understanding, and equal opportunity for all participants.
6. **Peer review, scientific rigor, and strong documentation** over unverified claims, to ensure the quality, dependability, and accessibility of our strategies.
7. **Data privacy, security, and user-friendly interfaces** over careless handling of sensitive information and poor navigation, to protect individual rights and interests while maintaining ease of use.
8. **Community-driven support and continuous learning** over stagnation, to foster collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and staying current with research and technology.
