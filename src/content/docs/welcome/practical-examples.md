# Let's get into the details
We have been pretty theoretical so far, let's dig into an example and it'll be more clear how this will work practically.

We see a major problem with many closed solutions that companies follow, only to realize they are not vetted or work as expected. In addition to climate project failures, these firms get labeled as greenwashing and are fearful to make further progress. We know we can do better.

We are heavily inspired by the open source and scientific community. These communities have brought forth some of the most stable and scalable innovations by valuing communities, openness, and sharing.

Our suggested approach is, like software producers, researchers, and consumers, are all different stakeholders, we will do the same.

# Creating climate solutions

(taxonomy/catergory is TBD)

## Instructions for a Scientist/innovator

Your role is to create climate solutions that can be easily understood, adopted, and implemented by climate specialists at corporations. Here are the steps to create climate solutions using the Markdown-based framework:

1. **Choose a Climate Solution Category:** Pick a category related to your area of expertise, such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, or carbon capture and storage.
2. **Create a Markdown File:** In the appropriate folder within the repository, create a new Markdown file for your climate solution. Use descriptive file names, such as `wave-energy.md` or `carbon-capture-storage.md`.
3. **Write a Clear Description:** Begin the document with a brief description of the climate solution. Explain its purpose, benefits, and potential impact on greenhouse gas emissions reduction.
4. **Provide Implementation Guidelines:** Describe the steps and best practices for implementing the solution. Include information on required resources, costs, and potential challenges.
5. **Include Examples:** Share successful examples or case studies of the solution being implemented in different contexts, emphasizing the outcomes and lessons learned.
6. **Provide Monitoring and Evaluation Tools:** Suggest tools and methodologies for tracking progress, evaluating the impact, and identifying areas for improvement. Include relevant metrics and performance indicators.
7. **Reference External Resources:** Link to relevant research papers, reports, or websites for further information on the climate solution.
8. **Collaborate and Revise:** Use Git for version control and collaboration. Address feedback from peers and update the document as needed. Encourage collaboration with other contributors and users to create synergies and new ideas for climate solutions.
9. All new Solutions are automatically in Alpha status

## Instructions for a Climate Specialist at a Corporation

As a climate specialist at a corporation, your role is to identify, customize, and implement sector-specific climate solutions using the Markdown-based framework. Here are the steps to implement a sector-specific solution:

1. **Identify Relevant Benchmarks or Programs:** Review the sector benchmarks (e.g., industry standards, regulatory requirements) or your company's specific program goals and objectives.
2. **Explore the Repository:** Browse the repository to find climate solutions that align with the identified benchmarks or program goals.
3. **Select Appropriate Solutions:** Choose climate solutions that can help meet or exceed the benchmarks or contribute to the company's program objectives. Review the provided implementation guidelines, examples, and monitoring tools.
4. **Customize Solutions:** Adapt the selected solutions to fit your company's specific needs and context. Make adjustments to the guidelines, examples, and tools as necessary.
5. **Create a Roadmap:** Develop a roadmap that outlines how the selected climate solutions will contribute to meeting sector benchmarks or achieving the company's program goals. Include timelines, resource allocation, and responsibilities.
6. **Implement and Monitor:** Execute the roadmap, following the provided guidelines and best practices. Use the monitoring and evaluation tools to track progress, assess the impact, and identify areas for improvement. Adjust the implementation plan and solutions as needed.
7. **Report Progress:** Document the progress made towards meeting sector benchmarks or achieving the company's program goals. Share updates and insights with relevant stakeholders, including management, employees, investors, and regulators.
8. **Collaborate and Learn:** Engage with other users and contributors in the repository to share experiences, provide feedback, and contribute to the ongoing improvement of climate solutions. Learn from others' experiences and incorporate best practices and new ideas into your company's program.

# Benchmarking

Benchmarking plays a crucial role in assessing the effectiveness of climate solutions and monitoring progress towards climate goals. By establishing a set of performance indicators and targets, organizations can better understand their current performance, identify areas for improvement, and track progress over time. The project will create solution plans for organizations in each sector to establish benchmarks. Corporations can use these benchmarks directly, customize them for their specific needs, or reference them while building their plan from scratch.

## Steps for Creating Benchmarks

1. **Identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Select relevant KPIs that reflect the effectiveness of the climate solutions in your sector. KPIs should be quantifiable, meaningful, and aligned with your organization's goals and objectives.
2. **Gather Data:** Collect historical data on the chosen KPIs for your organization or sector. This data will serve as a baseline for comparison and help you understand the current performance.
3. **Analyze Performance:** Analyze the collected data to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement. Use this analysis to inform your benchmarking process and set realistic targets.
4. **Establish Targets:** Set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) targets for each KPI. These targets will serve as benchmarks to gauge the success of your climate solutions.
5. **Monitor Progress:** Regularly track your organization's performance against the established benchmarks. Use the monitoring and evaluation tools suggested in the climate solutions to measure progress and assess the impact of your efforts.
6. **Compare with Peers:** Compare your organization's performance with that of other organizations in your sector. This process can help identify best practices, as well as opportunities for collaboration and learning.
7. **Adjust and Improve:** Based on your performance analysis, update your climate solutions, implementation plans, and benchmark targets as needed. This iterative process helps ensure continuous improvement and progress towards your climate goals.

## Customizing Benchmarks for Your Organization

While the project provides a set of sector-specific benchmarks, organizations may need to customize these benchmarks to better align with their unique circumstances and objectives. Consider the following factors when customizing benchmarks:

1. **Organizational Context:** Take into account your organization's size, geographical location, industry, and existing infrastructure. Adjust benchmarks to reflect the specific challenges and opportunities your organization faces.
2. **Available Resources:** Assess the resources at your disposal, such as financial, human, and technological resources. Set benchmark targets that are achievable given your resource constraints.
3. **Regulatory Environment:** Consider the regional or national regulations that govern your organization's operations. Ensure that your customized benchmarks comply with these regulations and incorporate any required reporting or compliance measures.
4. **Stakeholder Expectations:** Engage with internal and external stakeholders, such as employees, investors, customers, and regulators, to understand their expectations and priorities. Incorporate their feedback into your customized benchmarks and climate solutions.

By following these steps and considering these factors, organizations can create customized benchmarks that accurately reflect their specific circumstances and objectives. Using these benchmarks, corporations can effectively measure and track their progress in implementing climate solutions, ensuring continuous improvement and alignment with their climate goals.
