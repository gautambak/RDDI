# Welcome

Welcome to our proposed project to help use the wisdom of open source to attempt to solve climate change.

# The Issue

Today, there's a lot of "greenwashing," where companies claim to go green but fail to deliver. This harms the companies, the institutions that they use for help, and stakeholders who are misled. 

We need to break this cycle, and we believe an open-source and decentralized approach is the answer.

# The Big Idea

We're building a scientific community to collaboratively develop and review practical ways to mitigate climate change. 

We want to help sectors transition towards greener practices and be responsive as new technologies are developed.

# The Solution

We aim to create reliable guides known as "abatement plans" that are specific to different sectors. These guides, openly reviewed by the global scientific community, shall serve as a reference point for companies to implement greener practices.

We want to build a open source repo that anyone in the world is welcomed to contribute to and share actionable plans to help get to netZero. 

# Our inspiration

The time to talk is over.  We are facing a situation that is affecting millions of lives daily and will only get worst.  From governments to large investors and corporations, no group can single handily solve this problem.  We need everyone, including outsiders, to help move the world forward.

We are inspired by the open source engineering community, many of the software we use today are based on open source technologies(web servers, operating systems, browsers). In fact some of the most sophisticated software in the world was and is developed in a similar way.  

Perhaps climate isnâ€™t different? 

# Assurance

Walking the delicate balance between transparency and confidentiality, we believe in an open yet secure approach to validation. Independent firms can confidently assess companies' progress against our plans knowing that they're utilizing best practices. Our focus remains on protecting the confidentiality of viable information, while also ensuring rigorous standards are adhered to and real progress is being made.

We aim to transform the conventional 'black box' methods into a more sustainable, credible, and accountable process. Instead of secretive checks and validations, firms will engage with a robust and transparent system that strengthens rather than weakens their reputation and trust.
